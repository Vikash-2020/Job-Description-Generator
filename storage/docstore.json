It may not specify all duties, tasks, and assignments associated with a job.  It is not intended to limit or in any way modify the right of management to direct, assign, and control the work of employees in a unit.  Accuracy, attention to detail, ability to work effectively in a team environment, and ability to work in an atmosphere of multiple projects and shifting priorities are requirements of all jobs at ArentFox Schiff LLP.  Additional job related qualifications may be specified for some openings.
